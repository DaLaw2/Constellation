# Constellation v1.0.0 Release Notes

The first fully functional version. Implements the core multi-dimensional tagging system, solving the pain point of traditional folder structures that cannot handle multi-dimensional classification.

- **Flexible Tagging**: Apply multiple tags to a single folder/file for multi-dimensional classification
